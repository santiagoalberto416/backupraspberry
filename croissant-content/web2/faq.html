              Frequently asked questions (FAQ) or Questions and Answers (Q&A), are listed questions and answers, all supposed to be commonly asked in some context, and pertaining to a particular topic. The format is commonly used on email mailing lists and other online forums, where certain common questions tend to recur.
              "FAQ" is pronounced as either an initialism (F-A-Q) or an acronym. Since the acronym FAQ originated in textual media, its pronunciation varies; "F-A-Q", and "fack", are commonly heard. Depending on usage, the term may refer specifically to a single frequently asked question, or to an assembled list of many questions
              and their answers. Web page designers often label a single list of questions as a "FAQ", such as on Google.com, while using "FAQs"
              to denote multiple lists of questions such as on United States Treasury site
